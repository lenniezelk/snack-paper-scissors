# Welcome to Defold

This project was created from the "Rive" project template.

The settings in ["game.project"](defold://open?path=/game.project) are mostly set to default values. The Rive extension is added as a dependency and the render script is changed from the default to the one provided by the Rive extension.

The project contains a bootstrap ["main.collection"](defold://open?path=/main/main.collection) that includes a game object with a Rive model.

Check out [the documentation pages](https://defold.com/learn) for examples, tutorials, manuals and API docs. Also make sure to read the [Rive specific documentation](https://defold.com/extension-rive/).

If you run into trouble, help is available in [our forum](https://forum.defold.com).

Happy Defolding!
